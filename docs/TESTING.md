# Testing

Manual and dev-time testing notes. For automated test commands (Vitest, `cargo test`, BDD
suites), see [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md#testing). For "this broke, here's the fix" entries, see
[docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

## Manual QA walkthrough

- **Exercise the app from a dev build** (`bun run tauri dev`): import/scan a folder,
  play/pause/seek/volume, create a playlist, edit tags, check the equalizer, and anything
  specific to whatever you changed.
- **Real-hardware smoke test** — real audio device, real playback, tags, playlists, equalizer:
  ```bash
  cargo test --test smoke_test -- --ignored --nocapture
  ```
  (run from `src-tauri/`)

## Test design rules

Each of these describes a test that passed while the bug it named was live.

1. **A setup that makes the hazard impossible proves nothing.** Ask what state the bug needs,
   and check the fixture didn't remove it.
   `test_reconcile_appends_new_matches_and_evicts_stale_without_reordering`
   (`playlist/dynamic.rs`) starts from a populated playlist; an empty one can't show reordering.
   `equalizer.feature` scenarios start from `Given the equalizer is enabled`. For live-app
   measurements, confirm nothing covers the element (the first-run walkthrough, a modal), and
   that the input is realistic: audio actually playing and not muted, a real library rather
   than an empty one.
2. **Cover every ordering of the actors.** When operations interact (a user drag, a backend
   event, state restore, `library-changed` vs. a playlist edit), list the orderings and test
   each. A test of one ordering says nothing about the others.
3. **Assert from the outside, on values.** Check the resulting state (the reconcile test checks
   titles, UUIDs and positions), not only that `invoke` or a store method was called.
4. **Test the configuration that ships.** If a test must use another configuration, say so in
   the test name.
5. **Report measurements honestly.** Give the sample size, how much of the space was covered,
   and the failure count. "It passed" without those is anecdote. Sweep small spaces
   exhaustively. Tell apart *refused*, *no-op* and *silently wrong*; only the last is a defect.
   (The reconcile test's second pass asserts an explicit no-op.)
6. **Each test sets up the state it measures.** Never rely on an earlier test, step or probe
   having left the app in the right state.
7. **A test that pins a defect is part of the defect.** If fixing a module breaks tests that
   encoded its wrong behaviour, fix the tests. Don't route around the module in its caller.
8. **Every date or time a test depends on comes from a mocked clock or a fixed constant, never the real clock.**
   A test reading the real clock (`Date.now()`, `new Date()`, `chrono::Local::now()`) produces different
   values across runs, changes behaviour around midnight or bucket transitions, and fails silently across
   calendar or DST shifts. For example, `SongTable.test.ts` built its fixture with `Date.now() - 15 min`;
   when CI ran at 00:11 UTC the timestamp fell on the previous calendar day and rendered "Yesterday" instead
   of "15 minutes ago". Mock the clock (`vi.useFakeTimers` / `vi.setSystemTime`), pass fixed timestamps,
   or use fixed constants.

## Re-testing the first-run welcome screen / walkthrough tour

Both are gated by one-off flags in the `app_state` table of your dev database (`welcome_seen`,
`walkthrough_completed`) — once set they won't show again on relaunch. Clear them with:

```bash
sqlite3 <path-to-luminous.db> "DELETE FROM app_state WHERE key IN ('welcome_seen', 'walkthrough_completed');"
```

The db lives at `%APPDATA%\org.luminous.music\luminous.db` on Windows,
`~/.local/share/org.luminous.music/luminous.db` on Linux (respects `LUMINOUS_DATA_DIR` if set —
see `src-tauri/src/paths.rs`).

## Testing clean / new app installs (`LUMINOUS_DATA_DIR`)

To test fresh install onboarding, default pins, and first-run experiences without modifying or deleting your real user library, point the app at an isolated directory via the `LUMINOUS_DATA_DIR` environment variable:

- **PowerShell (Windows)**:
  ```powershell
  $env:LUMINOUS_DATA_DIR = "$env:TEMP\luminous-test"
  bun run tauri dev
  ```

- **Bash (Linux / macOS)**:
  ```bash
  LUMINOUS_DATA_DIR=/tmp/luminous-test bun run tauri dev
  ```

This causes Luminous to initialize a brand new `luminous.db`, `covers/`, and `logs/` directory in that location while leaving your primary database completely untouched. To reset between test runs, simply remove that temporary folder or point to a new path.

> [!NOTE]
> On Windows, WebView2 persists `localStorage` (such as last-viewed tabs or navigation state) across sessions in its User Data Directory (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\com.luminous.app\EBWebView`). When testing a genuinely pristine first launch, you can clear `localStorage` via the DevTools console (`Ctrl+Shift+I` -> `localStorage.clear(); location.reload()`) in addition to setting `LUMINOUS_DATA_DIR`.

### Scripted throwaway profiles (`scripts/throwaway-profile.ts`)

For automated scripts driving the real app (benchmarks, screenshots, tutorials), `scripts/throwaway-profile.ts` manages both `LUMINOUS_DATA_DIR` and `WEBVIEW2_USER_DATA_FOLDER` together:
- Creates an isolated temporary directory pair (`data` and `webview`).
- Exposes WebView2's remote debugging port (`--remote-debugging-port=9222`).
- Provides helpers (`startProfile`, `withProfile`, `AppProfile`) to launch, wait for CDP readiness, pre-seed or query SQLite `app_state`, cue songs, pin window geometry, and cleanly tear down.

## Testing against a local WebDAV server

To exercise WebDAV sync and playback without a real NAS, serve a folder of the repo's short audio
clips from [wsgidav](https://wsgidav.readthedocs.io) on loopback, with Basic auth so the credential
path is actually used. Copy a few files from `src-tauri/tests/fixtures/audio/` into a scratch
folder (outside the repo), then write a `wsgidav.yaml` beside it. `test-only-password` is a
throwaway value for this loopback server, not a real credential:

```yaml
host: 127.0.0.1
port: 8765
provider_mapping:
  "/": "<absolute path to the scratch folder>"
http_authenticator:
  accept_basic: true
  accept_digest: false
  default_to_digest: false
simple_dc:
  user_mapping:
    "*":
      "tester":
        password: "test-only-password"
        roles: []
```

```bash
uv run --with wsgidav --with cheroot wsgidav --config wsgidav.yaml
```

- **Use an isolated profile** (`LUMINOUS_DATA_DIR`, above) so the test server never lands in your
  real library. Add it under Settings, Sources, or call `save_webdav_server` over devtools; its
  input keys are camelCase (`remotePath`, not `remote_path`).
- **Drive the app** with `bun run monitor-cdp --eval "<js>"`, e.g.
  `window.__TAURI_INTERNALS__.invoke('play_song', { songId })`. Don't overlap sync invocations.
- **Credentials:** song rows must hold the plain URL. Saving a wrong password should make playback
  fail with a 401 toast that names no credentials, and restoring it should play again with no
  re-sync (#1492).
- **Folder-etag skipping (#1483):** stock wsgidav sends no folder etags, so testing that needs a
  custom provider that adds propagating etags.

## Windows UI automation

- **Windows e2e smoke test (`bun run test:e2e:windows`, `e2e/run-smoke.ts`)**: drives the real
  built app (real Rust backend, real IPC, real SQLite) through
  [`tauri-driver`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-driver) + `msedgedriver`, as opposed to
  the IPC-mocked `take-screenshots.ts`. One-time setup: `cargo install tauri-driver --locked`,
  then download the `msedgedriver` build matching your installed WebView2 Runtime version
  (`(Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\EdgeUpdate\Clients\{F3017226-FE2A-4295-8BDF-00C3A9A7E4C5}").pv`
  in PowerShell gives the version; download
  `https://msedgedriver.microsoft.com/<version>/edgedriver_win64.zip` and drop
  `msedgedriver.exe` into `~/.cargo/bin` — already on `PATH` from the `cargo install` above, and
  machine-wide rather than tied to one worktree). The script builds the app itself via
  `tauri build --debug --no-bundle` (skips the slow installer step, just compiles the binary) —
  both flags matter. It has to go through the `tauri` CLI specifically, not a plain
  `cargo build`: only the CLI's build pipeline embeds `frontendDist` into the binary, otherwise
  it loads `devUrl` (`http://localhost:1420`) and shows a blank/network-error page since this
  test runs no dev server there to load from. And it has to be a **debug**-profile build, not
  release: `build_prevent_default_plugin()` in `lib.rs` enables
  `tauri-plugin-prevent-default`'s full flag set only in release builds
  (`cfg!(debug_assertions)` false), which disables WebView2 devtools/accelerator keys — and that
  blocks the CDP channel `msedgedriver` needs to control the page, so the window just hangs at
  `about:blank` forever (and can eventually report "tab crashed"). `--debug` keeps devtools
  enabled by carving `DEV_TOOLS` out of that flag set. Each run points the app at a fresh temp
  directory via `LUMINOUS_DATA_DIR` (see `src-tauri/src/paths.rs`) so it never reads or writes
  your real library/database — never unset that env var when experimenting with this harness
  manually.
- **`bunx tsx scripts/inspect-app.ts` (dev-time app inspection, not a CI test)**: same one-time
  setup as the e2e smoke test above. Gives an agent (or a human) a way to launch the real app
  and visually inspect it while working on an issue — `start [--real]`, `click --css "<sel>"` /
  `click --text "<text>"`, `hover --css "<sel>"` / `hover --text "<text>"` (moves the pointer via
  the WebDriver Actions API so `:hover`/group-hover CSS actually engages, unlike a plain click —
  no separate "unhover"; start a fresh session or hover a neutral element to clear it),
  `type --css "<sel>" "<text>"`, `screenshot <path>` (add `--css "<sel>"` / `--text "<text>"` to
  crop to just that element via the driver's own element-screenshot endpoint — no manual
  devicePixelRatio math, and much easier to confirm pixel-level detail like a hover outline than
  eyeballing a full-page shot), `source`, `url`, `stop`. Each subcommand is a separate process;
  session state persists to `.inspect-session.json` (gitignored) between calls. `--real` points
  it at your actual library instead of an isolated temp dir — use it only for read-only visual
  comparisons, never for clicks that mutate state.

  For known failure modes of these two tools (flaky `--real` sessions, blank/crashing windows
  under GPU/session isolation), see [docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

## Proving a change is visually neutral (`bun run style-diff`)

For "no visual change" work (Tailwind/dependency upgrades, theme-store or component refactors),
`scripts/style-diff.ts` diffs the computed style and box of every visible element, plus a
screenshot, on the mocked IPC harness (same as `take-screenshots.ts`, so no backend or data dir).
It covers the system theme in light and dark, the playbar-only layout and the Miniplayer
(`bun run style-diff states`). Playback is paused, animations are frozen and visualisers hidden.

1. On the unchanged code: `bun run style-diff capture base`, then `capture base2`. The second
   run is the noise baseline: anything that differs between the two is masked.
2. Make the change, then `bun run style-diff capture after`.
3. `bun run style-diff compare base after --noise=base2`. It exits 1 on any remaining difference,
   listing elements whose authored properties changed (reflow-only moves are counted, not
   listed) and writing `.style-diff/after/<state>.diff.png` with changed pixels in red.

Captures live in `.style-diff/` (gitignored). `--states=a,b` limits a capture to some states.

## Remote devtools for headless/agent debugging

An agent (or a developer without desktop access to the running window) can inspect the live
webview's Console/DOM/Network state without driving the app through WebDriver. This is automatically
enabled in dev builds via `package.json`'s `tauri` script (`LUMINOUS_REMOTE_DEVTOOLS=true`), and is a no-op
in release builds regardless (`remote_devtools_enabled()` in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`).

Launch the dev server normally:

```bash
bun run tauri dev
```

(Or explicitly pass `LUMINOUS_REMOTE_DEVTOOLS=true` / `$env:LUMINOUS_REMOTE_DEVTOOLS = "true"` if running `tauri dev` directly without `bun run tauri`.)

Then, from a browser (e.g. Claude's Browser pane — `mcp__Claude_Browser__navigate`), open
`http://127.0.0.1:9222`:

- **Linux (WebKitGTK)**: this lists inspectable views; open one to get the full Web Inspector
  (Console/DOM/Network) as a normal webpage.
- **Windows (WebView2)**: `http://127.0.0.1:9222/json` lists Chrome DevTools Protocol targets;
  each has a `devtoolsFrontendUrl` that serves the Chrome DevTools UI over plain http.

Nothing is exposed unless the env var is set, and it's a no-op in release builds regardless
(`remote_devtools_enabled()` in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`).

**Limitation**: a browser attached to the inspector frontend sees *that page's own* console via
its own tooling, not Luminous's — to read Luminous's actual console/network/DOM state, read the
Console/DOM/Network panels rendered inside the inspector UI itself (e.g. via a page-text or
screenshot read), not a structured log feed.

### CLI monitoring and diagnostics (`scripts/monitor-cdp.ts`)

For programmatic inspection without opening a browser, use the CDP monitoring script (`bun run monitor-cdp` or `bun run scripts/monitor-cdp.ts`):

```bash
# Check renderer health and event loop latency
bun run monitor-cdp

# Continuous watch mode (reports latency, document.title, and visibility state every 2s)
bun run monitor-cdp --watch

# Evaluate arbitrary JavaScript inside the running WebView2
bun run monitor-cdp --eval "document.title"
bun run monitor-cdp --eval "document.querySelectorAll('canvas').length"

# Test window minimization, background responsiveness, and restoration
bun run monitor-cdp --minimize --duration 15
```

This verifies that the WebView2 renderer thread does not lock up during background playback, window occlusion, or minimization (#1052).
