# Issue Priority & Status

Priority (P1–P4) and Status (Todo/In Progress/Done/Parked) are tracked exclusively as fields on
the "Luminous Music Player" GitHub Project (`gh project` number `3`, owner `esoltys`) — never as
labels. Both are readable and settable directly through the `gh project` CLI; there's no need to
ask the user to update them by hand or fall back to a label as a substitute.

## Adding a new issue to the board

A freshly created issue isn't a Project item yet, so it has no Priority/Status to read or set
until it's added:

```bash
gh project item-add 3 --owner esoltys --url <issue-url> --format json --jq .id
```

This prints the new item's `id` (also for an issue already on the board), which is exactly what
`item-edit` below needs — capture it rather than listing the board to find it again.

## Reading current values

```bash
gh project item-list 3 --owner esoltys --format json --query "<filter>"
```

Each item in the result includes `priority` and `status` directly, plus `content.number` so you
can match it to a specific issue.

`item-list` has no sort order and returns only 30 items unless you pass `--limit`; the board holds hundreds of
items, so an unfiltered list silently drops issues. Filter on GitHub's side with
`--query` instead of fetching everything — plain text matches titles, and it takes the Projects
filter syntax, e.g. `--query "Cyrillic"`, `--query "milestone:3.0 status:Todo"`. If you really need
the whole board, pass `--limit 1000` and check `totalCount` against the number of items returned.

## Setting a value

Use the item's `id` from `item-add` above (or from an `item-list --query` result, matching on
`content.number`), then:

```bash
gh project item-edit --project-id PVT_kwHOAAE3ZM4BgXrH --id <item-id> \
  --field-id <field-id> --single-select-option-id <option-id>
```

**Priority** — field id `PVTSSF_lAHOAAE3ZM4BgXrHzhakJHw`:

| Option | id |
| --- | --- |
| P1 | `89eea1e7` |
| P2 | `145b89a5` |
| P3 | `3c790d36` |
| P4 | `1db7b067` |

**Status** — field id `PVTSSF_lAHOAAE3ZM4BgXrHzhakFIo`:

| Option | id |
| --- | --- |
| Todo | `f75ad846` |
| In Progress | `47fc9ee4` |
| Done | `98236657` |
| Parked | `02ee74f6` |

If the Project's fields are ever recreated, these IDs will change — re-run `gh project field-list
3 --owner esoltys --format json` and update this table.

## Priority scheme

Every bug/feature issue gets a Priority when it's created, regardless of milestone — set Status
to "Todo" and assign a Priority using this scheme (2.0-milestone issues additionally use it to
indicate when they should be worked on after 1.0 ships):

### Bugs
- **P1** — Critical system down with no workaround (stops the app from working as designed; if the user can still use the app then it's not a P1).
- **P2** — Severe degradation, workaround exists.
- **P3** — Limited impact, single function affected.
- **P4** — Inconvenience, cosmetic.

### Features
- **P1** — Foundational/first-run work that other issues depend on.
- **P2** — Features touched often, expected for parity with comparable desktop music players, or
  that encourage exploring the library (cover art, artist bios and connections, browsing by
  genre) rather than just playing tracks.
- **P3** — Lower-frequency or power-user features.
- **P4** — Speculative, large-scope, or low-demand work; revisit after core 2.0 features ship.

Don't default new issues to P2/P3 — assign a priority using the same criteria above.
