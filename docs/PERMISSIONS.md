# Human Touchpoints in the Pipeline

Everything here is a point where a human has to act — not just review — before the
pipeline can proceed. Grounded in what's actually in `.github/workflows/` and
`docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`. See [`docs/CI.md`](./CI.md) for the full pipeline this fits
into. Microsoft Store submission is covered only briefly below — it lives in the separate
private repo `esoltys/luminous-store`, whose own `README.md` is the source of truth for
that part.

| Action | Why it needs a human | What the human must do |
|---|---|---|
| Pushing the release PR to `main` | `RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` explicitly says not to pass `--push` to `bun run release` "that pushes the branch straight to `main`, bypassing branch protection and skipping review." Branch protection on `main` is asserted by the checklist's wording, not something visible in the workflow YAML itself. | Open a PR from the release worktree branch into `main` and get it reviewed/merged normally. |
| Pushing the `vX.Y.Z` tag | This repo's CLAUDE.md states tag pushes are protected and automated (Claude/CI) pushes of `v*` tags get a 403 from GitHub. Pushing the tag is also what triggers `release.yml`'s build, so it's a deliberate gate on when the expensive signed build kicks off, not just a permissions accident. | Run `git tag -d vX.Y.Z && git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z" && git push origin vX.Y.Z` against `main`'s tip (after the release PR has merged) from a human's own credentials. |
| Watching the `release.yml` run to completion | The workflow builds signed Linux and Windows bundles across a matrix; a failure on either leg (e.g. the noted transient 503s from `tauri-apps/binary-releases`, retried up to 3x via `wretry.action` but not guaranteed to succeed) needs a human to notice and re-run or investigate. Nothing in the pipeline pages anyone automatically. | `gh run watch`, or the checklist's optional Beeper notification, until both matrix legs finish. |
| Editing and publishing the draft GitHub release | `release.yml` always creates the release as a **draft** (`gh release create ... --draft`, and `softprops/action-gh-release` is passed `draft: true` explicitly, with a comment noting that omitting `draft` would auto-publish). This is a deliberate content gate — the auto-generated release body is not the real release notes. | Replace the body with `docs/release-notes/vX.Y.Z.md`, optionally toggle "Create a discussion for this release," then click Publish in the GitHub UI. |
| Triggering Microsoft Store submission | Store submission is a separate, manual step in the private `esoltys/luminous-store` repo — nothing in `luminous` triggers it automatically once a release is published. It submits the MSIX via StoreBroker's `Update-ApplicationSubmission -ReplacePackages` (and `-UpdateListings` when refreshing screenshots/listing text). A green run only means the submission was **committed for certification** — the actual review/cert pass happens entirely on Microsoft's side. | In `luminous-store`: `gh workflow run publish-store.yml -f tag=vX.Y.Z` (add `-f update_screenshots=true` if also replacing listing text/screenshots), then separately check the submission's status in Partner Center until certification completes and the update goes live. |
| Retrying a failed/stuck Store submission | `publish-store.yml` (in `luminous-store`) requires a `tag` input on every run — re-running it doesn't rebuild anything, it just re-submits the already-uploaded MSIX. Choosing to do this requires human judgment about *why* the prior submission needs retrying (e.g. it was rejected, or needs re-submission after a `sbConfig.json` fix). | Trigger `publish-store.yml` manually in `luminous-store` via `workflow_dispatch`, supplying the release tag. |
| Publishing or updating an add-on | Add-on bundles are built, signed and published from the private `esoltys/luminous-store` repo by a manual `workflow_dispatch` workflow; nothing in `luminous` or on merge does it, so a merged add-on change does not reach users until someone runs it. | In `luminous-store`, after the change has merged: run the "Publish add-on" workflow with the add-on's folder name. That repo's docs are the source of truth. |
| Testing add-ons on the real Store | The purchase dialog, Store entitlement check and key release only run in a packaged build installed from the Store, and no CI job can run one. A package flight has to be built, uploaded, certified and installed by hand. | Build a Windows package locally with a version above the public one, upload it to a package flight in Partner Center, wait for certification, install it and exercise the add-on while watching the key Worker's logs. Details are in `luminous-store`'s docs. |
| Manual `release.yml` dispatch | `release.yml` also accepts a bare `workflow_dispatch` with no inputs, which derives the tag from `package.json`'s version instead of a pushed tag ref. This bypasses the tag-push gate above, so it's a judgment call about when that's appropriate (the checklist doesn't document a scenario for using it). | Trigger `release.yml` manually via `workflow_dispatch` if needed; verify the resulting draft release/tag are correct since no tag was pushed to anchor them. |
| Installing and manually verifying the new build | The checklist requires downloading and installing the new build on at least one real machine per platform (Windows + Linux), and manually confirming the in-app updater picks up the release from an older install — neither is something CI does. | Download the published release assets, install on real hardware, exercise the app and the updater flow end to end. |
| Running the pre-release verification suite | None of `bun run check`, `bun run test:run`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy --all-targets`, or the smoke test (`cargo test --test smoke_test -- --ignored --nocapture`) run in any GitHub Actions workflow — they are entirely manual steps in `RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`. A PR can merge to `main` without any of these having run in CI. | Run each command locally before cutting a release, per the checklist; fix any pre-existing `cargo clippy` warnings encountered, not just new ones. |
| Closing/linking resolved GitHub issues | Not automated by any workflow; the checklist calls this out as a manual post-build step. | Close or link the issues resolved by the release and update the milestone if one's in use. |

## Secrets referenced in the workflows (existence not independently verified)

The workflow YAML *references* the following repository secrets. This document only
confirms they are referenced in the YAML — it does not and cannot confirm from the
workflow files alone that they are correctly configured, non-expired, or scoped
correctly in the repo's Settings → Secrets, since that's not visible from the checked-in
code:

- `GITHUB_TOKEN` — used throughout (`gh release` commands, `tauri-action`, MSIX upload);
  this one is provided automatically by GitHub Actions per run, not manually configured.
- `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` / `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD` — used by
  `tauri-action` in `release.yml` to sign the updater artifacts. If these are ever
  rotated, that's a manual credential-management action outside any workflow shown here.

`STORE_TENANT_ID` / `STORE_CLIENT_ID` / `STORE_CLIENT_SECRET` / `STORE_APP_ID` (an Azure AD
app registration tied to the Partner Center account, per StoreBroker's own setup docs) live
in the separate `esoltys/luminous-store` repo's secrets, not this repo's — this repo's
workflows no longer reference them. The same goes for everything add-on related (the bundle
signing and encryption keys, the Cloudflare credentials, and the key Worker's Microsoft
credentials): they live in `luminous-store`'s secrets and in Cloudflare, and nothing in this
repo references them.

If any of these secrets are missing, expired, or wrong, the corresponding workflow will
fail at the step that consumes them; investigating that is itself a manual, human step
since there's no automated secret-health check in this pipeline.
