Luminous is a fast, local-first player for your own audio library. Built for anyone who wants the convenience of a modern streaming app without giving up ownership of their music. Turn a folder of files into a library you'll enjoy browsing and listening to.

## Architecture

"Isn't this just a web wrapper?" Not in the Electron sense. Tauri renders the UI in the OS's own webview (WebView2 on Windows, WebKit on Linux/macOS) instead of bundling a full Chromium, so there's no shipped browser engine inflating the binary or idling in RAM. And the UI is the only part that's web tech — audio decoding/output, DSP, the library scanner, and the SQLite index all run as native Rust off the UI thread, driving the frontend through events rather than the other way around. See below for how the two sides split.

Luminous splits cleanly along the Tauri boundary: a Svelte 5 frontend handles UI, state, and rendering, while a Rust backend owns everything performance- or system-sensitive — audio decoding and playback, the SQLite-backed library index, file scanning, and OS media integration. The two sides talk over Tauri's IPC layer, with the frontend invoking commands and the backend emitting events for things like playback position, scan progress, and now-playing metadata. Keeping decoding, DSP, and disk I/O in Rust off the UI thread is what lets a multi-thousand-track library scan, gapless-playback, and real-time visualizers stay smooth at once.

The IPC commands are deliberately *deep*: each one owns a whole workflow rather than forwarding a single field. The backend owns the built-in Queue (bootstrapped at startup, exposed via an `is_queue` flag — the frontend never infers it from a name), applies equalizer changes as one whole-config call, and keeps every dynamic playlist — genre/decade/BPM auto playlists and user smart playlists alike — *always complete*: whenever the library or a song's stats change, a backend reconciler immediately appends newly-matching songs and evicts stale ones, syncing the live play order without ever reshuffling it. There is no refill logic, and no such setting, anywhere in the frontend.

## Building Luminous

Luminous is a cross-platform application that can be built and run on both Linux and Windows.

### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian, Arch/CachyOS)

#### 1. Install System Dependencies
Ensure the required build tools, GTK, WebKit, ALSA, and SSL development headers are installed:

*   **Ubuntu/Debian**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y build-essential curl wget file libssl-dev libgtk-3-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libsoup-3.0-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev libasound2-dev pkg-config cmake
    ```
*   **Arch/CachyOS**:
    ```bash
    sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel curl wget file openssl gtk3 webkit2gtk-4.1 libappindicator-gtk3 librsvg pkg-config
    ```

#### 2. Install Bun & Rust
*   **Bun**: Install the JavaScript runtime & package manager:
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
    ```
*   **Rust**: Install the Rust toolchain:
    ```bash
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    ```

#### 3. Run Development Server

```bash
bun install
bun run install:git-hooks # sets core.hooksPath to use the repository's tracked .githooks/pre-commit hook
bun run tauri dev
```
#### 4. Build Production Bundle
Production bundles include updater artifacts, which must be signed. If you haven't generated a signing keypair yet, see [Generating an Updater Signing Key](#generating-an-updater-signing-key) below first.
```bash
bun run tauri build
```
This produces `.deb`/`.rpm`/AppImage on Linux.
> [!NOTE]
> On rolling-release distros (Arch/CachyOS), the AppImage step bundles `strip` binaries too old to handle the RELR relocations in current system libraries. `bun run tauri build` sets `NO_STRIP=true` for this automatically, so no extra steps are needed here — it only skips stripping debug symbols from vendored libraries, slightly increasing AppImage size.

---

### Windows

#### 1. Install Microsoft C++ Build Tools
Download and install the [Visual Studio Installer](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/). Select the **Desktop development with C++** workload and ensure the MSVC C++ build tools are checked.

#### 2. Install Bun & Rust
Install the JavaScript runtime, package manager, and Rust toolchain

```powershell
winget install Oven-sh.Bun Rustlang.Rustup
```

#### 3. Run Development Server
Run the following commands in your terminal (e.g., PowerShell or Command Prompt):
```powershell
bun install
bun run tauri dev
```

#### 4. Build Production Bundle
Production bundles include updater artifacts, which must be signed. If you haven't generated a signing keypair yet, see [Generating an Updater Signing Key](#generating-an-updater-signing-key) below first.
```powershell
bun run tauri build
```

---

### Generating an Updater Signing Key

Luminous's `tauri.conf.json` has `bundle.createUpdaterArtifacts` set to `true`, so `bun run tauri build` signs every bundle it produces. Without a signing key in the environment, the build fails. Official releases are signed with a repository secret (see [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml)), but for local builds you need your own keypair:

1. Generate a keypair (you'll be prompted to set a password, or pass `--ci` to skip it):
    ```bash
    bunx tauri signer generate -w ~/.tauri/luminous.key
    ```
    This writes the private key to `~/.tauri/luminous.key` and prints the corresponding public key.
2. Set the private key and its password as environment variables before building:
    ```bash
    export TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY="$(cat ~/.tauri/luminous.key)"
    export TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD="your-password"
    ```
    On Windows (PowerShell):
    ```powershell
    $env:TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY = Get-Content -Raw "$HOME\.tauri\luminous.key"
    $env:TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD = "your-password"
    ```
3. Run `bun run tauri build` as usual. Your own key won't match the `updater.pubkey` baked into `tauri.conf.json`, so a locally-built app can't verify updates signed by the official release key (and vice versa) — that's expected for local builds and only matters if you're testing the updater flow itself.

## Testing and Specifications

Luminous uses automated tests at both the frontend (Svelte 5) and backend (Rust) layers.

### Frontend Unit & Integration Tests (Vitest)

Frontend tests are written with Vitest and test component rendering, Svelte 5 stores, and state updates with mocked Tauri APIs.

To run the frontend test suite:
```bash
bun run test:run
```

### Backend Unit & Integration Tests (Rust)

To run the standard cargo unit test suite:
```bash
cd src-tauri
cargo test
```
This also runs the Gherkin feature specs under [`features/`](features) — each `.feature` file has a matching test in `src-tauri/tests/`, so no separate command is needed to exercise them.
